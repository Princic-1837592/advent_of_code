# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## [2022](2022) (Python)

My first "live" AoC. ~~I skipped day 19 because I am too lazy to solve yet another backtracking problem~~.\
Day 16 gave me such a headache that I had to skip both 16 and 17, but I went back to them shortly afterwards.

## [2021](2021) (Python)

Going to finish this, ~~sooner~~ or **later**.

## [2020](2020) (Rust)

Second AoC solved at 100%.
Left day 20 for last (yet another backtracking problem) but in the end it was easy to solve.

## [2019](2019) (Rust)

I proudly skipped every day with an `Intcode` problem.
The day I'm most proud of is [day 18](2019/day_18.rs),
which I solved without consulting Reddit and runs in 6ms total.
Other days I liked:

- [6](2019/day_06.rs)
- [14](2019/day_14.rs)
- [20](2019/day_20.rs)
- [24](2019/day_24.rs)

## [2018](2018) (Rust)

Third AoC solved at 100%.

## [2017](2017) (Rust)

Fourth AoC solved at 100%, with the best animation so far.\
My favourite days:

- [9](2017/day_09.rs) funny parsing
- [12](2017/day_12.rs)
- [21](2017/day_21.rs) reminded me of [2020/20](2020/day_20.rs)
- [24](2017/day_24.rs)
- [25](2017/day_25.rs)

## [2016](2016) (Rust)

Finally, I know why The Easter Bunny is on the Naughty List.\
The first part of [day 11](2016/day_11.rs) was a pain, but the second part was the easiest second part ever.\
My favourite days:

- [13](2016/day_13.rs) an easy BFS after the infamous [day 11](2016/day_11.rs)
- [20](2016/day_20.rs)
- [22](2016/day_22.rs) the first time I solved a problem by hand (second part)

## [2015](2015) (Rust)

First AoC solved at 100%. I took the opportunity to improve my Rust. I am proud of this one.
