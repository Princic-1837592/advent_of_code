# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## 2022 (Python)

My first "live" AoC. I skipped day 19 because I am too lazy to solve yet another backtracking problem.\
Day 16 gave me such a headache that I had to skip both 16 and 17, but I went back to them shortly afterwards.

## 2021 (Python)

Going to finish this, ~~sooner~~ or **later**.

## 2020 (Rust)

Second AoC solved at 100%.
Left day 20 for last (yet another backtracking problem) but in the end it was easy to solve.

## 2018 (Rust)

Third AoC solved at 100%.

## 2015 (Rust)

First AoC solved at 100%. I took the opportunity to improve my Rust. I am proud of this one.
